/*
We use the integers a, b, and n to create the following series:
(a+2^0.b), (a+2^0.b+2^1.b), ...., (a+2^0.b+2^1.b+ ... +2^(n-1).b)

You are given q queries in the form of a, b, and n. For each query, print the series corresponding to the given a, b, and n values as a single line of n space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of queries.
Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective a(i), b(i), and n(i) values for that query.

Constraints
0<=q<=500
0<=a, b<=50
1<=n<=15
Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of n space-separated integers.
